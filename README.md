# Data-Acquisition-Using-SQL-inside-of-R
I am posting some code showing how I accessed a SQL database from inside of R by passing SQL queries through the packages DBConnect and RMySQL. This project demonstrates my skills writing SQL quieries to gather data from a relational database.

The database requires a username and password which cannot be provided by me and is not shown in the code.

Note - DBConnect, a package required in this project, does not work with R version 4.
